    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided</li>
      <li>8 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast, diced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups frozen mixed vegetables</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place ramen noodles in a bowl. Set seasoning packet aside. Pour boiling
        water over noodles until they are submerged; set aside while you start
        the stir-fry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat,
        swirling to coat the entire pan. Add chicken and stir to coat with oil.
        Add oyster sauce and 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Stir-fry chicken until no
        longer pink and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add frozen vegetables. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and let steam until
        heated through and soft, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and 1 teaspoon
        minced garlic; stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture
        to a serving bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain softened ramen noodles, reserving 2 tablespoons soaking water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining sesame oil in a pan over medium heat. Add reserved
        soaking water along with 1/2 of the ramen seasoning packet, remaining
        soy sauce, remaining garlic, and chili powder. Add ramen noodles; cook
        and stir constantly until coated and water has evaporated, 2 to 3
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to serving bowls and top with chicken and vegetable mixture.
      </li>
    </ol>
